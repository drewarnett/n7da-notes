# Ten-Tec Scout

* Very good condition.
* All modules.
* NB option.
* Hand microphone.
* Power cord.
* Mobile mount kit.

The mobile mount kit does not appear to have ever been used.  There is a
handwritten note in the box that suggests this radio was used for a local club
Field Day at least once.  The 160m band module note (see below) is an
interesting tidbit of knowledge I hadn't heard about before.  The huff-n-puff
frequency stabilizer works, except during key down by the built in keyer.  I'd
use an external keyer if using paddles.  The continuously adjustable Jones
filter is an interesting feature.
